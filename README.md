# **Job Scheduler using Min Heap and Red Black Tree**

## Project Description

Wayne Enterprises is developing a new city. They are constructing many buildings and plan to use software to keep track of all buildings under construction in this new city. A building record has the following fields:  
`buildingNum` : unique integer identifier for each building.  
`executedTime` : total number of days spent so far on this building.  
`totalTime` : the total number of days needed to complete the construction of the building.

The needed operations are:

1. `PrintBuilding(buildingNum)` prints the triplet (buildingNum,executedTime,totalTime).
2. `PrintBuilding(buildingNum1, buildingNum2)` prints all triplets bn, executedTime, totalTime for which buildingNum1 <= bn <= buildingNum2.
3. `Insert(buildingNum,totalTime)` where buildingNum is different from existing building numbers and executedTime = 0.

A `min heap` is used to store `(buildingNum,executedTime,totalTime)` triplets ordered by `executedTime`. A `Red Black Tree (RBT)` is used store `(buildingNum,executedTime,totalTime)` triplets ordered by `buildingNum`.

Wayne Enterprises works on one building at a time. When it is time to select a building to work on, the building with the lowest `executedTime` (ties are broken by selecting the building with the lowest `buildingNum`) is selected. The selected building is worked on until complete or for 5 days, whichever happens first. If the building completes during this period its number and day of completion is output and it is removed from the data structures. Otherwise, the buildingâ€™s `executedTime` is updated. In both cases, Wayne Construction selects the next building to work on using the selection rule.
